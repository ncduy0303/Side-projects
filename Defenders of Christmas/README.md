# Defenders of Christmas
  - This is a PC game created by myself and my club members when I was in still in my secondary school Informatics Club back in 2016.
  - Unfortunately, I am not able to find the old source code. This exe file was accidentially discovered in my Dropbox. =))
  - A credit and sincere thanks to the club, now located at: [@clbtinhoctdn](https://www.facebook.com/clbtinhoctdn/)
  - Hope that somebody will download and enjoy the game! =))
